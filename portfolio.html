<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I holds a bachelor degree in computer science where in which i focused on theories during my universies, something i can say it was education only without practical skills, So i have joined moringa school to match these theories with knowledge of programming. </p>
<p>I currently have web building , Communication and searching skills i got from the program. Beyond of that i personally enjoy making friends doing aerobics, reading and driving.</p>
